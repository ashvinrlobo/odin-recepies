    <h2>Biryani</h2>
    <p>Biryani is a beloved and complex mixed rice dish originating from the Indian subcontinent.  It's a fragrant and flavorful combination of rice, meat (typically chicken, goat, lamb, or beef, but also sometimes seafood or vegetables for vegetarian versions), aromatic spices, and often yogurt, creating a rich and layered culinary experience.</p>

        <li>2 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>1 (2 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken pieces cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 pound basmati rice</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>5 pods cardamom</li>
        <li>3 whole cloves</li>
        <li>1 (1 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 pinch powdered saffron</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Chicken:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces with the 4 tablespoons of vegetable oil (divided), 2 large finely chopped onions, 2 minced garlic cloves, 1 tablespoon minced ginger, 2 chopped tomatoes, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, ½ teaspoon chili powder, ½ teaspoon ground black pepper, ½ teaspoon ground turmeric, 2 tablespoons plain yogurt, 2 tablespoons chopped mint leaves, ½ teaspoon ground cardamom, and the 2-inch cinnamon stick. Mix well and marinate for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong> Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add the marinated chicken and cook over medium heat until the chicken is browned and cooked through.  Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Rice:</strong> Rinse the 1 pound of basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes. Drain the rice.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Aromatics:</strong> In the same pot you cooked the chicken, heat 2 ½ tablespoons of vegetable oil. Add the 1 diced large onion and sauté until golden brown. Add 5 cardamom pods, 3 whole cloves, and 1-inch cinnamon stick. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Rice and Spices:</strong> Add the drained rice to the pot and sauté for a few minutes until the grains are coated with oil. Add ½ teaspoon ground ginger and a pinch of powdered saffron. Mix well.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Chicken Stock and Salt:</strong> Pour in 4 cups of chicken stock and 1 ½ teaspoons of salt. Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Chicken and Rice:</strong> Return the cooked chicken to the pot with the rice. Gently mix everything together.</li>
        <li><strong>Steam the Biryani:</strong> Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot tightly, and let the biryani simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and the liquid is absorbed. Do not lift the lid frequently during this process.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest and Serve:</strong> Once cooked, remove the pot from the heat and let the biryani rest for 10 minutes, still covered. This allows the flavors to meld together. Gently fluff the rice with a fork before serving.</li>
      </ol>
