      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the chicken with yogurt, lemon juice, salt, garam masala, turmeric powder, chili powder, cumin, and coriander. Mix well and marinate for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong> Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken and cook until browned on all sides and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Aromatics:</strong> In the same skillet, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the chopped onion and sauté until golden brown. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Tomatoes and Simmer:</strong> Stir in the crushed tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Cream and Chicken:</strong> Stir in the heavy cream and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the cooked chicken back to the skillet and mix well.</li>
